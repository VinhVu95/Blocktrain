Some basic blockchain Rest API implementation. The service allows:
 *  creating new node in blockchain network
 *  creating a single chain with genisis block initialization for each node
 *  perform mining (Proof-Of-Work), adding new transaction to the chain
 *  synchronisation between nodes with Consensus algorithm

 TODO: Allow creating secure transactions between user within blockchain network
